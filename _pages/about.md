I am a highly motivated medical imaging scientist with a desire to improve patient outcomes through development of medical devices, point-of-care technologies, and minimally-invasive therapies. I am a proponent of science communication to all levels, and have honed my skills through international research collaborations, numerous conference presentations, and contributing articles to an advice column called [Gradhacker](https://www.insidehighered.com/users/megan-poorman). I have also completed a [rotation in Interventional Radiology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/nih-nibib-t32eb021937/) where I witnessed first-hand the power of clinical collaboration when designing engineering solutions to meet clinical needs. 

I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2014 with a BS in Biomedical Engineering and a minor in Electrical Engineering. I followed this up with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from [Vanderbilt University](https://vuiis.vumc.org/), which I completed in 2018. My dissertation work focused on Magnetic Resonance temperature mapping for guidance of thermal therapies and development of a preclinical MR-guided focused ultrasound system. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Institute for Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/pml/applied-physics-division/magnetic-imaging). My current research involves validation of quantitative imaging methods and development of novel contast mechanisms for techniques such as MR Fingerprinting and low-field MRI. 

My work has been published in multiple peer-reviewed journals and software featured by the [Focused Ultrasound Foundation](https://www.fusfoundation.org/news/open-source-focused-ultrasound-system-now-available-to-researchers-around-the-world). I have a patent pending for an MR thermometry technique developed in 2020. A full list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_whgkpcAAAAJ&hl=en), as well as conference proceedings and talks in [my CV](poormanme.github.io/cv/). I am an advocate of open science and code sharing. My distribution-ready algorithms can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/poormanme/) page, with more always in development behind the scenes. 

Outside of lab I can usually be found going up mountains, whether it be via snow, hiking, running, or rock climbing shoe. Sometimes I go down them too.
