My main research focus is in quantiative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Conventional MRI used in the clinic today is mostly qualitative - images are acquired of the patient with various contrasts. These weighted images are sent to an expert radiologist who draws margins and makes diagnosis based on the images. However, the same acquisition can yield different contrasts between different people, or even the same person on different days or a different MRI scanner. Quantiative MRI offers the potential to make measurements of the human body that are independent of variations in the scanner or person. Additionally, quantiative MRI can offer measurable feedback about the body's internal functions. Unfortunately, there are still many barriers to wide clinical adoption of quantiative MRI into the clinic. 

I have interests ranging from MR Fingerprinting and quantiative MRI algorithm development to interventional, minimally-invasive therapies and point of care applications with low-field MR. 

This page is a work in progress and will be updated with project descriptions and links to relevant publications at somepoint in the near future.
